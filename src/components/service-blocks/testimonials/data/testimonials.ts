    text: "I was always looking at where it intersects with the skill base of the team and the customer service, communication, project management.

Versus you have the opposite which is really good project management and really excellent communication but not so great development team. And what I've enjoyed working with Interexy is the fact that I get both of those pieces together and that has been very satisfactory.",

The two areas that I think where Stan & his team particularly excel: first is attention to detail (…) & secondly the kind of support they’ve provided after the app was largely complete. I’m sure the number of teams just do the bug work & leave it but they are [Interexy team] always on hand to answer any questions really at any time of day which is incredible.',
