      'By allowing partners on a blockchain to create all the framework conditions for their relationships, smart contracts provide greater transparency. Since they are stored on a shared blockchain ledger, they cannot be removed',

      'Smart contract code is triggered automatically by an on-chain transaction, with immediate execution of the contract when the rules are met. This reduces the need for any escrow, paperwork and prevention of manual errors',
