      <li>
        <strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about
        your device’s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much
        information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to

        legitimate business interests.
      </em>
    </p>

    <h3>For those located in the EU or UK</h3>

    <p>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the
      valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such,
      we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us
        permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific
        purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal

        <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we
        believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests
        and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and
        freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
        purposes described in order to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we
        believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to
        cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
        legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we
        are involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe
        it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third
        party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For those located in Canada</h3>

    <p>
      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,
      express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
      situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can
      withdraw your consent at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
      process your information without your consent, including, for example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
        obtained in a timely way;

      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention;</li>
      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met;</li>
      <li>
        If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to
        assess, process, or settle an insurance claim;
      </li>
      <li>
        For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of
        kin;

      <li>
        If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
        victim of financial abuse;
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
        availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable
        for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention
        of the laws of Canada or a province;
      </li>
      <li>
        If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
        rules of the court relating to the production of records;
      </li>
      <li>
        If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business,
        or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
        information was produced;
      </li>
      <li>
        If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes;

    <h3>Withdrawing your consent</h3>

    <p>
      If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be
      express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right
      to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section “How can you
      contact us about this notice?” below.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
      before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing
      of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
      other than consent.
    </p>

    <h3>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications</h3>

    <p>
      You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by
      clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, replying “Stop” or
      “Unsubscribe” to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the
      details provided in the section “How can you contact us about this notice?” below.
      You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate
      with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for
      the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for
      other non-marketing purposes.

      Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
      usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you
      choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or

      10. Controls for do-not-track features
    </h2>

    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include
      a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
      preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
      collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
      implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
      DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
      choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
      we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
      version of this privacy notice.

    <h4>Verification process</h4>

    <p>
      Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you
      are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These
      verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can
      match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending
      on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
      that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have
      on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
      that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods
      as the circumstances dictate.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
      identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid
      requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
      However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
      by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
      verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will
      delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
    </p>

    <h4>Other privacy rights</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
      <li>
        You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer
        relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your
        behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof
        that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with
        the CCPA.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal
        information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon
        the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from
        the date of the request submission.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Virginia residents</h3>

    <p>Under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA):</p>

    <p>
      “Consumer” means a natural person who is a resident of the Commonwealth acting only
      in an individual or household context. It does not include a natural person acting
      in a commercial or employment context.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Personal data” means any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an
      identified or identifiable natural person. “Personal data” does not include
      de-identified data or publicly available information.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Sale of personal data” means the exchange of personal data for monetary
      consideration.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this definition of “consumer” applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights
      and obligations regarding your personal data.
    </p>

    <h4>Your rights with respect to your personal data:</h4>

      <li>Right to correct inaccuracies in your personal data;</li>
      <li>Right to request deletion of your personal data;</li>
      <li>Right to obtain a copy of the personal data you previously shared with us;</li>
      <li>
        Right to opt out of the processing of your personal data if it is used for
        targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, or profiling in furtherance of
        decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects (“profiling”).

    </p>

    <h4>Verification process</h4>

    <p>
      We may request that you provide additional information reasonably necessary to
